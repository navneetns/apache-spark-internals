= [[ExternalSorter]] ExternalSorter

*ExternalSorter* is a xref:shuffle:Spillable.adoc[Spillable] of `WritablePartitionedPairCollection` of pairs (of K keys and C values).

`ExternalSorter[K, V, C]` is a parameterized type of `K` keys, `V` values, and `C` combiner (partial) values.

== [[creating-instance]] Creating Instance

ExternalSorter takes the following to be created:

* [[context]] xref:scheduler:spark-TaskContext.adoc[TaskContext]
* [[aggregator]] Optional xref:rdd:spark-Aggregator.adoc[Aggregator] (default: undefined)
* [[partitioner]] Optional xref:rdd:Partitioner[Partitioner] (default: undefined)
* [[ordering]] Optional Scala's http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/math/Ordering.html[Ordering] for keys (default: undefined)
* [[serializer]] xref:ROOT:spark-Serializer.adoc[Serializer] (default: xref:ROOT:spark-SparkEnv.adoc#serializer[system Serializer])

ExternalSorter is created when:

* SortShuffleWriter is requested to xref:shuffle:SortShuffleWriter.adoc#write[write records] (as a `ExternalSorter[K, V, C]` or `ExternalSorter[K, V, V]` based on xref:rdd:ShuffleDependency.adoc#mapSideCombine[Map-Size Partial Aggregation Flag])

* BlockStoreShuffleReader is requested to xref:shuffle:BlockStoreShuffleReader.adoc#read[read records] (with sort ordering defined)

== [[buffer]][[map]] In-Memory Collections

ExternalSorter uses PartitionedPairBuffers or PartitionedAppendOnlyMaps to store objects in memory before spilling to disk. ExternalSorter uses PartitionedPairBuffers when created with no <<aggregator, Aggregator>> specified. With an Aggregator, ExternalSorter uses PartitionedAppendOnlyMaps.

ExternalSorter creates a PartitionedPairBuffer and a PartitionedAppendOnlyMap when created.

ExternalSorter inserts records to the collections when <<insertAll, insertAll>>.

ExternalSorter <<maybeSpill, maybeSpill>> and, if spilled to disk, creates a new collection.

ExternalSorter releases the collections (``null``s them) when requested to <<forceSpill, forceSpill>> and <<stop, stop>>. That is whne the JVM garbage collector takes care of evicting them from memory whatsoever.

== [[spills]] Spills Internal Registry

ExternalSorter manages spilled files.

== [[insertAll]] Inserting Records

[source, scala]
----
insertAll(
  records: Iterator[Product2[K, V]]): Unit
----

insertAll branches off per whether the optional <<aggregator, Aggregator>> was <<insertAll-shouldCombine, specified>> or <<insertAll-no-aggregator, not>> (to create the <<creating-instance, ExternalSorter>>).

insertAll takes all records eagerly and materializes the given records iterator.

=== [[insertAll-shouldCombine]] Map-Side Aggregator Specified

If there is an Aggregator specified, insertAll creates an update function based on the xref:rdd:spark-Aggregator.adoc#mergeValue[mergeValue] and xref:rdd:spark-Aggregator.adoc#createCombiner[createCombiner] functions of the Aggregator.

For every record, insertAll xref:shuffle:Spillable.adoc#addElementsRead[increment internal read counter].

insertAll requests the <<map, PartitionedAppendOnlyMap>> to changeValue for the key (made up of the <<getPartition, partition>> of the key of the current record and the key itself, i.e. `(partition, key)`) with the update function.

In the end, insertAll <<maybeSpillCollection, maybeSpillCollection>> (with the usingMap flag on since the <<map, PartitionedAppendOnlyMap>> was updated).

=== [[insertAll-no-aggregator]] No Map-Side Aggregator Specified

With no Aggregator specified, insertAll iterates over all the records and uses the <<buffer, PartitionedPairBuffer>> instead.

For every record, insertAll xref:shuffle:Spillable.adoc#addElementsRead[increment internal read counter].

insertAll requests the <<buffer, PartitionedPairBuffer>> to insert with the <<getPartition, partition>> of the key of the current record, the key itself and the value of the current record.

In the end, insertAll <<maybeSpillCollection, maybeSpillCollection>> (with the usingMap flag off since this time the <<buffer, PartitionedPairBuffer>> was updated, not the <<map, PartitionedAppendOnlyMap>>).

=== [[insertAll-usage]] Usage

insertAll is used when:

* SortShuffleWriter is requested to xref:shuffle:SortShuffleWriter.adoc#write[write records] (as a `ExternalSorter[K, V, C]` or `ExternalSorter[K, V, V]` based on xref:rdd:ShuffleDependency.adoc#mapSideCombine[Map-Size Partial Aggregation Flag])

* BlockStoreShuffleReader is requested to xref:shuffle:BlockStoreShuffleReader.adoc#read[read records] (with sort ordering defined)

== [[writePartitionedFile]] Writing Partitioned File

[source, scala]
----
writePartitionedFile(
  blockId: BlockId,
  outputFile: File): Array[Long]
----

writePartitionedFile...FIXME

writePartitionedFile is used when SortShuffleWriter is requested to xref:shuffle:SortShuffleWriter.adoc#write[write records].

== [[stop]] Stopping ExternalSorter

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

stop...FIXME

stop is used when:

* BlockStoreShuffleReader is requested to xref:shuffle:BlockStoreShuffleReader.adoc#read[read records] (with sort ordering defined)

* SortShuffleWriter is requested to xref:shuffle:SortShuffleWriter.adoc#stop[stop]

== [[spill]] Spilling Data to Disk

[source, scala]
----
spill(
  collection: WritablePartitionedPairCollection[K, C]): Unit
----

spill requests the given WritablePartitionedPairCollection for a destructive WritablePartitionedIterator.

spill <<spillMemoryIteratorToDisk, spillMemoryIteratorToDisk>> (with the destructive WritablePartitionedIterator) that creates a SpilledFile.

spill adds the SpilledFile to the <<spills, spills>> internal registry.

spill is part of the xref:Spillable.adoc#spill[Spillable] abstraction.

== [[spillMemoryIteratorToDisk]] spillMemoryIteratorToDisk Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
spillMemoryIteratorToDisk(
  inMemoryIterator: WritablePartitionedIterator): SpilledFile
----

spillMemoryIteratorToDisk...FIXME

spillMemoryIteratorToDisk is used when:

* ExternalSorter is requested to <<spill, spill>>

* SpillableIterator is requested to spill

== [[maybeSpillCollection]] Spilling In-Memory Collection to Disk

[source, scala]
----
maybeSpillCollection(
  usingMap: Boolean): Unit
----

maybeSpillCollection...FIXME

maybeSpillCollection is used when ExternalSorter is requested to <<insertAll, insertAll>>.

== [[iterator]] iterator Method

[source, scala]
----
iterator: Iterator[Product2[K, C]]
----

iterator...FIXME

iterator is used when BlockStoreShuffleReader is requested to xref:shuffle:BlockStoreShuffleReader.adoc#read[read combined records for a reduce task].

== [[partitionedIterator]] partitionedIterator Method

[source, scala]
----
partitionedIterator: Iterator[(Int, Iterator[Product2[K, C]])]
----

partitionedIterator...FIXME

partitionedIterator is used when ExternalSorter is requested for an <<iterator, iterator>> and to <<writePartitionedFile, write a partitioned file>>

== [[logging]] Logging

Enable `ALL` logging level for `org.apache.spark.util.collection.ExternalSorter` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `conf/log4j.properties`:

[source]
----
log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.util.collection.ExternalSorter=ALL
----

Refer to xref:ROOT:spark-logging.adoc[Logging].
